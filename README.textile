h1. A Prototype-wrapper around JW FLV Player

This package consists of a wrapper class around JW FLV Player. It 
makes it much nicer to work with the player in JavaScript 
than by just using the default interface.

Featues:
* The class frees the programmer from worrying about when the player is
  loaded. It is thus save to add event handlers or call
  commands before the player is ready.
  
* The class mimicks Prototype's event handling.
  
* Commands, such as play, pause and skip, are regular instance methods.
  This removes the need to call <code>sendEvent</code> over and over again.

Example:

<pre>
var jwplayer = new JWPlayer('container-element-id', {
  file: 'video.flv',
  width: 475,
  height: 300
});
jwplayer.observe('model:time', function(event) {
  console.log(event.position);
});
jwplayer.setFullscreen(true);
jwplayer.play();
</pre>

h2. Requirements

This small utility is rather demanding in requirements by requiring Prototype, 
however, it could easily be made framework independent. Uses swfobject 2 to 
embed the Flash player.
