h1. A Prototype-wrapper around JW FLV Player

This package contains a class that wraps around JW FLV Player. It 
integrates with/uses Prototype and makes it much nicer to work with the 
player in JavaScript than just using the default JavaScript interface.

Example:

<pre>
var jwplayer = new JWPlayer('container-element-id', {
  file: 'video.flv',
  width: 475,
  height: 300
});
jwplayer.observe('model:time', function(event) {
  console.log(event.position);
});
</pre>
